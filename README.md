### Key Features of the Roblox Dead Rails Script

3. **Aimbot and Auto-Farming**  
   A common feature found in many Roblox scripts, including Dead Rails, is the aimbot functionality. This allows players to automatically lock onto enemies, making it easier to hit targets and win combat scenarios. Additionally, auto-farming capabilities can help you grind resources and level up your character faster, without having to manually do all the hard work.

4. **Visual and Graphical Enhancements**

   One of the most appealing features of this script is its ability to unlock unlimited resources, including in-game currency, rare items, and other valuable assets. This can significantly boost your progress and give you access to high-tier content that would otherwise take hours of grinding to unlock.

6. **Anti-Ban Features**
